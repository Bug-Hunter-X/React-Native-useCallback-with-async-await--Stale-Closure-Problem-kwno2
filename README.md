# React Native useCallback with async/await: Stale Closure Problem

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native when using `useCallback` with asynchronous operations, specifically `async/await` within a `fetch` call.  The problem arises because the memoized function retains a reference to the original `url` prop, even if the prop updates.  This leads to stale closure and fetching outdated data.

## Problem Description

The `useCallback` hook is intended to memoize functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders. However, if the function performs an asynchronous operation and its dependencies change *after* the function is memoized, it won't re-execute with the updated values. 

The solution involves carefully managing dependencies and potentially using a more sophisticated approach to handle asynchronous operations within the memoized function.

## Solution

The provided solution demonstrates how to correctly handle this situation by ensuring the asynchronous operation always uses the latest values. This is addressed by ensuring the use of appropriate state management and careful consideration of dependency arrays in hooks.
